* Leetmouse GUI
** Description
   This python3 based GUI is supposed to offer an easy way to interface with the driver kernel module.
   
   Besides from just setting the acceleration parameters, it aims to also visualize the applied curve.

** Modifying the GUI
   We use =PyQt5= for rendering the GUI and [[https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html][Qt Designer]] for creating the GUI.
   The gui layout for the main window is stored in =gui.ui= as XML and can be edited with =Qt Designer=.
   To export the XML data to python code, run
   #+begin_src sh
   pyuic5 gui.ui -o gui.py
   #+end_src
